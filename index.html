Add the pumpkin puree, egg, and vanilla. Beat until well-blended. In another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and pumpkin pie spice.

Place powdered sugar in a medium bowl and set aside. Melt the unsalted butter in a small saucepan over low-medium heat, stirring frequently. Cook until the butter foams, the foam dissipates, and it turns a deep golden brown with a nutty aroma, about 10 minutes. Be attentive to avoid burning. Remove from heat and let cool for 2-3 minutes. Carefully pour the brown butter over the powdered sugar. Add milk and vanilla, then vigorously whisk the mixture until smooth. Spread approximately 1 tablespoon of icing onto each cooled cookie.
